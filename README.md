# Rules
## Setup
1. Each player gets half the (shuffled) deck

## To Play
2. Each player flips over the top card from their deck
3. The player with the higher ranked card gets both and puts them in their winner's deck
4. If both players flip a card that is identical in rank, a war is initiated. Which means that each player will put down 3 face down cards. Then a 4th face up card is placed. Which ever player has the highest ranked card will win the war and all the cards.
5. Game stops when players get bored or when one player is out of cards.
